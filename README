NorNet Demo
==========

A demonstration program for NorNet Core Distributed Network Testbed.

The purpose of this software suit is demonstrating what the NorNet Core testbed is about. 
This will be done through visualization of various communication scenarios between nodes in the NorNet testbed. 
It is also a goal that the scenarios include the elements that make NorNet stand out from other networking testbeds; 
namely the multi-homed nature of the nodes, and the support of IPv6 for all nodes.
